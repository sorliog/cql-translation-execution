// Condition w/ onsetDate, abatementDate
[Condition: "Chlamydia"] C where interval[C.onsetDate, C.abatementDate] overlaps MeasurementPeriod

// Condition, Asthma started before 14 August 2013
// QUICK vs Raw FHIR
// QUICK:

// FHIR:
[Condition: "Asthma"] C

// FHIR w/ Profiling to require status = 'confirmed' and only onset/abatementDate values:
